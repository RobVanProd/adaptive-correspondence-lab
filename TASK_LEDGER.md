## ACL-001 — Initial experimental substrate

- **Status:** complete
- **Observed behavior:** no implementation exists; only a research design is available.
- **Hypothesis:** under stationary shared rewards and an identity mapping on the
  interior of a finite simplex, exact replicator flow, multiplicative weights,
  and a categorical natural-gradient step produce the same next distribution.
  Controlled violations can be summarized as an epsilon-to-delta response curve.
- **Frozen semantics:** probabilities are float64 vectors on a closed simplex;
  analytic log/Fisher operations require strictly positive probabilities; rewards
  are maximized; exact replicator flow freezes the supplied reward over a step;
  categorical natural gradient uses centered logits; distances are L1 unless a
  command explicitly selects another metric; random streams are seeded PCG64
  generators; their complete state and a compact fingerprint are recorded before
  stochastic draws.
- **Allowed files:** all files created under `D:\adaptive-correspondence-lab`.
- **Acceptance tests:** analytic vector fields agree; exact three-way trajectories
  agree within a frozen float64 tolerance; Euler local error scales quadratically;
  accelerated batches match the reference path; stochastic runs replay from a seed;
  every record carries required instrumentation; Gaussian and contextual-bandit
  analytic checks pass; CLI produces machine-readable artifacts; lint and full tests pass.
- **Risks:** confusing exact flow with Euler discretization; singular categorical
  Fisher matrices; accidental RNG coupling across compared worlds; interpreting a
  numerical smoke test as a scientific result; memory growth in large seed sweeps.
- **Stop conditions:** an implementation requires an unfrozen semantic choice; the
  change crosses into neural policies or hardware acceleration; the baseline build
  is red; observed disagreement cannot be separated from a numerical defect.

### ACL-001 completion record

- **Implementation:** added three instrumented categorical worlds, nine named
  assumption violations, bounded NumPy batches, epsilon-to-delta and coefficient-
  transport protocols, analytic/rank-mu Gaussian optimization, exact/sampled
  contextual-bandit natural policy gradient, strict artifact serialization, and CLI.
- **Source checkpoint:** `48d3c5c5ef96c59fe18f6cd5b3d27a44d0fcccc6`.
- **Verification:** 47 tests passed; Ruff passed; wheel build passed; measured test
  coverage was 87%; `acl demo` and `examples/minimal.py` completed on the development
  host.
- **Immutable software evidence:** `evidence/software-verification.json` and
  `evidence/categorical-equivalence.json` both record the clean source checkpoint and
  pass. `evidence/mutation-stability.*` is a deterministic example curve, not a
  scientific claim.
- **Remaining uncertainty:** no independent scientific review has occurred; the
  transported-coefficient command demonstrates protocol plumbing within the same
  categorical correspondence and does not validate transport to a new system class;
  sample estimators have reproducibility tests but no statistical calibration claim.
- **Regression risks:** boundary states in finite populations cannot be represented
  by categorical logits; large Euler steps deliberately fail instead of projecting;
  long traces grow linearly because complete instrumentation and RNG states are kept.
- **Recommended next action:** preregister one perturbation, metric, epsilon grid,
  horizon, seed ensemble, and source/target split before treating any curve as research
  evidence.

## ACL-002 — Preregister categorical mutation stability

- **Status:** preregistered, not executed; confirmatory execution remains forbidden
  until the public checkpoint SHA receives explicit approval.
- **Observed behavior:** ACL-001 contains a deterministic mutation format example but
  no confirmatory manifest, analytic tangent propagation, frozen estimator, transport
  gate, or immutable preregistration bundle.
- **Hypotheses:** for the row-vector update
  `q_next = (1-epsilon) F(q) + epsilon F(q) M`, the endpoint L1 discrepancy has
  zero-fit coefficient `C = ||s_T||_1`, where
  `s_next = s J_F^R(p) + p_next (M-I)`. Separately, a landscape-balanced median source
  calibration may transport to held-out targets. For oriented
  `KL(q_T || p_T)`, the zero-fit quadratic coefficient is
  `K = 0.5 sum_i s_i^2 / p_i`.
- **Frozen semantics:** probabilities and sensitivities are row vectors;
  `(J_F^R)_[i,j] = partial F_j / partial p_i`; every `M` is row-stochastic and mutation
  is right multiplication; primary endpoint L1 uses `T=20`; secondary horizons are
  `1,5,50`; the epsilon grid is
  `0,1e-4,3e-4,1e-3,3e-3,1e-2,3e-2,1e-1`; the five positive values through `1e-2`
  are confirmatory and the last two are non-gating stress points; source calibration
  is the median of per-landscape origin fits; empirical quantiles use Hyndman-Fan Type
  7 (`method="linear"`); analytic and calibrated predictions receive separate verdicts.
- **Sensitivity strata:** the inherited float64 verification tolerance is `2e-14`;
  the frozen safety multiplier is `100`, giving `delta_floor=2e-12`. Analytic zero is
  represented by `C<=2e-14`. A nonzero landscape is low-sensitivity when
  `C * 1e-2 < 2e-12`. These strata are determined without perturbed outcomes, excluded
  from relative-error gates, reported separately, and judged by absolute error against
  `delta_floor`.
- **Transport gate:** for each regular target landscape, take the Type-7 median of its
  five confirmatory relative errors. Across those landscape-level scores, success
  requires Type-7 median `<=0.10` and Type-7 0.90 quantile `<=0.20`. Apply this gate
  independently to `alpha=1` and to the frozen median source calibration. Stress points,
  secondary horizons, max-path L1, and KL cannot change either verdict.
- **Allowed files:** `TASK_LEDGER.md`, `README.md`, `docs/experiments.md`,
  `src/adaptive_correspondence/acl002.py`, `src/adaptive_correspondence/cli.py`,
  `tests/test_acl002.py`, and files under `preregistrations/ACL-002/`.
- **Acceptance tests:** toy fixtures (never the confirmatory manifest) check the row
  Jacobian against finite differences, tangent sensitivity against finite differences
  in epsilon, mass conservation, the KL coefficient, per-landscape alpha, median
  aggregation, Type-7 quantiles, strata, manifest/lock validation, separate gates, and
  execution guards. Full tests, Ruff, wheel build, and preregistration-only validation
  must pass.
- **Risks:** an implicit transpose; treating deterministic landscapes as seed
  replicates; allowing high-sensitivity landscapes to dominate calibration; unstable
  relative errors; reversing KL orientation; leaking stress results into the verdict;
  accidentally executing the confirmatory manifest while preparing the checkpoint.
- **Stop conditions:** any confirmatory mutation outcome is generated; a manifest
  choice changes after inspecting perturbed results; an unresolved metric or estimator
  choice appears; tests require the confirmatory landscapes; the baseline turns red.

### ACL-002 preregistration completion record

- **Implementation:** froze the narrative preregistration, row-vector derivation,
  analysis plan, 14-source/14-target manifest, clean analytic registry, SHA-256 bundle
  lock, landscape-balanced estimators, separate analytic/calibrated gates, special-
  stratum handling, complete raw reporting schema, and guarded future runner.
- **Regression sequence:** `tests/test_acl002.py` first failed because the ACL-002
  module did not exist; implementation then satisfied 13 ACL-002 toy-fixture tests.
- **Verification:** preregistration-only validation passed with 28 landscapes, 24
  regular cases, two analytic-zero cases, two low-sensitivity cases, and
  `outcomes_generated=false`; the complete suite passed 60 tests; Ruff passed; measured
  coverage was 84%; wheel build passed. A manifest-only audit found no duplicate
  landscape combinations, unused catalog entries, or exact source/target overlap.
- **Commands:** `python -m pytest tests/test_acl002.py -q`, `python -m ruff check .`,
  `python -m pytest -q`, `python -m pytest --cov=adaptive_correspondence
  --cov-report=term -q`, `python -m pip wheel . --no-deps --wheel-dir dist`, and
  `acl acl002-validate`.
- **Confirmatory status:** `acl acl002-run` was not invoked. No epsilon-positive
  trajectory from the ACL-002 manifest and no confirmatory outcome artifact exists.
- **Remaining uncertainty:** the manifest and derivation have not yet received their
  requested final human review; primary hypotheses may pass or fail once executed;
  secondary high-horizon sensitivities can be large and remain non-gating by design.
- **Regression risks:** changing any locked bundle file invalidates `LOCK.json`; future
  execution requires the exact approved full SHA, a clean tracked worktree, a matching
  clean analytic registry, and a previously nonexistent output path.
- **Recommended next action:** review the public manifest, derivation, analytic registry,
  and checkpoint SHA. If and only if accepted, explicitly approve that exact SHA for a
  later one-shot confirmatory execution.
