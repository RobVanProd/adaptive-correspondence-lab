## ACL-001 — Initial experimental substrate

- **Status:** in progress
- **Observed behavior:** no implementation exists; only a research design is available.
- **Hypothesis:** under stationary shared rewards and an identity mapping on the
  interior of a finite simplex, exact replicator flow, multiplicative weights,
  and a categorical natural-gradient step produce the same next distribution.
  Controlled violations can be summarized as an epsilon-to-delta response curve.
- **Frozen semantics:** probabilities are float64 vectors on a closed simplex;
  analytic log/Fisher operations require strictly positive probabilities; rewards
  are maximized; exact replicator flow freezes the supplied reward over a step;
  categorical natural gradient uses centered logits; distances are L1 unless a
  command explicitly selects another metric; random streams are seeded PCG64
  generators; their complete state and a compact fingerprint are recorded before
  stochastic draws.
- **Allowed files:** all files created under `D:\adaptive-correspondence-lab`.
- **Acceptance tests:** analytic vector fields agree; exact three-way trajectories
  agree within a frozen float64 tolerance; Euler local error scales quadratically;
  accelerated batches match the reference path; stochastic runs replay from a seed;
  every record carries required instrumentation; Gaussian and contextual-bandit
  analytic checks pass; CLI produces machine-readable artifacts; lint and full tests pass.
- **Risks:** confusing exact flow with Euler discretization; singular categorical
  Fisher matrices; accidental RNG coupling across compared worlds; interpreting a
  numerical smoke test as a scientific result; memory growth in large seed sweeps.
- **Stop conditions:** an implementation requires an unfrozen semantic choice; the
  change crosses into neural policies or hardware acceleration; the baseline build
  is red; observed disagreement cannot be separated from a numerical defect.
